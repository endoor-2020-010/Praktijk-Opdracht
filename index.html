      <img class="img" src="./images/title-text-image.jpg" alt="Title image about covid 19">
      <p>
        Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome
        coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The disease was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, the capital of
        China's Hubei province, and has since spread globally, resulting in the ongoing 2019–20 coronavirus
        pandemic. Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath. Other symptoms may include
        fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhoea, sore throat, loss of smell and abdominal pain. The time from
        exposure to onset of symptoms is typically around five days, but may range from two to fourteen days.
        While the majority of cases result in mild symptoms, some progress to viral pneumonia and multi-organ
        failure. As of 11 April 2020, more than 1.69 million cases have been reported in more than 200
        countries and territories, resulting in more than 102,000 deaths. More than 376,000 people have
        recovered.
      </p>

      <p>
        The virus is mainly spread between people during close contact, often via small droplets produced during
        coughing, sneezing, or talking. While these droplets are produced when breathing out, they usually
        fall to the ground or surfaces rather than being infectious over large distances. People may also
        become infected by touching a contaminated surface and then their face. The virus can survive on surfaces
        for up to 72 hours. Coronavirus is most contagious during the first three days after onset of symptoms,
        although spread may be possible before symptoms appear and in later stages of the disease.
      </p>

      <p>
        The standard method of diagnosis is by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) from
        a nasopharyngeal swab. Chest CT imaging may also be helpful for diagnosis in individuals were there is a
        high suspicion of infection based on symptoms and risk factors but is not recommended for routine
        screening.
      </p>

      <p>
        Recommended measures to prevent infection include frequent hand washing, maintaining physical distance from
        others (especially from those with symptoms), covering coughs and sneezes with a tissue or inner elbow and
        keeping unwashed hands away from the face. The use of masks is recommended for those who suspect they
        have the virus and their caregivers. Recommendations for mask use by the general public vary, with some
        authorities recommending against their use, some recommending their use and others requiring their
        use. Currently, there is no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19. Management
        involves treatment of symptoms, supportive care, isolation and experimental measures.
      </p>

      <p>
        The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the 2019–20 coronavirus outbreak a Public Health Emergency of
        International Concern (PHEIC) on 30 January 2020 and a pandemic on 11 March 2020. Local transmission
        of the disease has been recorded in many countries across all six WHO regions.
      </p>

      <h2 id="signs-and-symptoms">Signs and symptoms</h2>
      <img class="img text-side-images" src="./images/signs-and-symptoms.png" alt="Signs and symptoms table">
      <p>
        Those infected with the virus may be asymptomatic or develop flu-like symptoms, including fever, cough, fatigue,
        and shortness of breath. Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or
        pressure, confusion, difficulty waking and bluish face or lips; immediate medical attention is advised if these
        symptoms are present. Less commonly, upper respiratory symptoms, such as sneezing, runny nose or sore throat
        may be seen. Symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea have been observed in varying
        percentages. Some cases in China initially presented only with chest tightness and palpitations.
        In March 2020 there were reports indicating that loss of the sense of smell (anosmia) may be a common symptom
        among those who have mild disease, although not as common as initially reported. In some, the
        disease may progress to pneumonia, multi-organ failure and death. In those who develop severe symptoms,
        time from symptom onset to needing mechanical ventilation is typically eight days.<br><br>

        As is common with infections, there is a delay between the moment when a person is infected with the virus and
        the time when they develop symptoms. This is called the incubation period. The incubation period for COVID-19 is
        typically five to six days but may range from two to 14 days. 97.5% of people who develop symptoms will
        do so within 11.5 days of infection.<br><br>

        Reports indicate that not all who are infected develop symptoms, but their role in transmission is unknown.
        Preliminary evidence suggests asymptomatic cases may contribute to the spread of the disease. The
        proportion of infected people who do not display symptoms is currently unknown and being studied, with the Korea
        Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reporting that 20% of all confirmed cases remained
        asymptomatic during their hospital stay. China's National Health Commission began including asymptomatic
        cases in its daily cases on 1 April, of the 166 infections on that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic.

        <h2>What measures is each EU country taking?</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Major measures taken in the EU to stop the spread of coronavirus!</strong><br>
          The coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak has spread to different regions in Europe. Member states are taking
          similar - but different - courses of action to fight the spread of coronavirus, despite the efforts of the
          European Commission to coordinate a common EU response.

          The role of the commission is mainly to support EU countries and provide recommendations based on scientific
          evidence and proportionality.

          However, member states are taking largely uncoordinated, piecemeal and even contradictory measures - which
          ultimately might undermine the common efforts to fight the outbreak.

          Last week, EU health ministers urge solidarity after Germany, France, and the Czech Republic blocked the
          export of anti-virus gear.

          Likewise, some member states are reintroducing border controls or even closing border for non-nationals.

          In Europe, all member states have registered cases of coronavirus, although there are major differences
          between eastern and western countries.

          However, the most affected country is Italy which represents about 58 percent of EU's cases - followed by
          Spain, Germany and France.

          According to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the risk of infection is moderate
          for the general population and high for older adults and individuals with chronic underlying conditions.

          The EU-27 leaders held a teleconference on Tuesday (10 March) focusing on containing the spread of the virus
          and mitigating the economic fallout.

          Meanwhile, European markets plunged on Thursday (12 March) after investors were spooked by the European
          Central Bank response, the Donald Trump travel ban on mainland Europe, and after the World Health Organisation
          (WHO) officially declared coronavirus a global pandemic.

          The WHO said on Friday that Europe has become the epicentre of the pandemic - with more reported cases and
          deaths than the rest of the world combined.

          In addition, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control believes that there is a high risk that
          the EU's healthcare capacity "will be exceeded."

          Non-essential travel to Europe will be banned for 30 days in an effort to contain the virus and encourage EU
          leaders to reopen internal borders.

          China has offered to send 2.2 million masks and 50,000 testing kits to the EU, commission president Ursula von
          der Leyen said on Wednesday (18 March).

        <h2 id="pandemic">What is a pandemic?</h2>
        <p>
          A pandemic is an epidemic of disease that has spread across a large region, for instance, multiple continents
          or worldwide, affecting a substantial number of people. A widespread endemic disease with a stable number of
          infected people is not a pandemic. Widespread endemic diseases with a stable number of infected people such as
          recurrences of seasonal flu are generally excluded as they occur simultaneously in large regions of the globe
          rather than being spread worldwide.<br>

          Throughout history, there have been a number of pandemics of diseases such as smallpox and tuberculosis. One
          of the most devastating pandemics was the Black Death (also known as The Plague), which killed an estimated
          75–200 million people in the 14th century. Other notable pandemics include the 1918 influenza pandemic
          (Spanish flu) and the 2009 flu pandemic (H1N1). Current pandemics include HIV/AIDS and the 2019–20 coronavirus
          pandemic.
        </p>
        <h3>Definition and stages</h3>
        <img class="img text-side-images" src="./images/definition-stages-img.png" alt="Definition and stages table">
        <p>
          A pandemic is an epidemic occurring on a scale that crosses international boundaries, usually affecting people on a
          worldwide scale. A disease or condition is not a pandemic merely because it is widespread or kills many people; it
          must also be infectious. For instance, cancer is responsible for many deaths but is not considered a pandemic because
          the disease is neither infectious nor contagious.<br><br>
        
          The World Health Organization (WHO) previously applied a six-stage classification to describe the process by which a
          novel influenza virus moves from the first few infections in humans through to a pandemic. This starts with the virus
          mostly infecting animals, with a few cases where animals infect people, then moves through the stage where the virus
          begins to spread directly between people and ends with a pandemic when infections from the new virus have spread
          worldwide. In February 2020, a WHO spokesperson clarified that "there is no official category [for a pandemic]".<br><br>
        
          In a virtual press conference in May 2009 on the influenza pandemic, Dr. Keiji Fukuda, Assistant Director-General ad
          interim for Health Security and Environment, WHO said "An easy way to think about pandemic ... is to say: a pandemic
          is a global outbreak. Then you might ask yourself: 'What is a global outbreak'? Global outbreak means that we see both
          spread of the agent ... and then we see disease activities in addition to the spread of the virus."<br><br>
        
          In planning for a possible influenza pandemic, the WHO published a document on pandemic preparedness guidance in 1999,
          revised in 2005 and in February 2009, defining phases and appropriate actions for each phase in an aide-mémoire titled
          WHO pandemic phase descriptions and main actions by phase. The 2009 revision, including definitions of a pandemic and
          the phases leading to its declaration, were finalized in February 2009. The pandemic H1N1 2009 virus was neither on
          the horizon at that time nor mentioned in the document. All versions of this document refer to influenza. The
          phases are defined by the spread of the disease; virulence and mortality are not mentioned in the current WHO
          definition, although these factors have previously been included.

        <h3>The History of Pandemics</h3>
        <p>
          As humans have spread across the world, so have infectious diseases. Even in this modern era, outbreaks are nearly
          constant, though not every outbreak reaches pandemic level as the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) has.<br><br>
          Today’s visualization outlines some of history’s most deadly pandemics, from the Antonine Plague to the current
          COVID-19 event.

        <h2 id="timeline-historical-pandemics">A Timeline of Historical Pandemics</h2>
        <p>
          Disease and illnesses have plagued humanity since the earliest days, our mortal flaw. However, it was not until the
          marked shift to agrarian communities that the scale and spread of these diseases increased dramatically.<br><br>
        
          Widespread trade created new opportunities for human and animal interactions that sped up such epidemics. Malaria,
          tuberculosis, leprosy, influenza, smallpox, and others first appeared during these early years.<br><br>
        
          The more civilized humans became – with larger cities, more exotic trade routes, and increased contact with different
          populations of people, animals, and ecosystems – the more likely pandemics would occur.<br><br>
        
          Here are some of the major pandemics that have occurred over time:
